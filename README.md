The end goal of this project is to develop a machine learning model to predict the winner of NBA games. 

There are some obvious parameters I plan on using in the model, such as home v. away, team strength, injuries, etcetera. But there are also some less obvious ones. For example, do longer road trips lead to less wins? That is what I tested in the first part of this project, and the results of that analysis are in the TravellingVsWinning.ipynb. 

The next step is to start building the model!
