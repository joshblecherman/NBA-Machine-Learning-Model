    "*I was thinking of how we could factor in injury data into our prediction. Here is one approach: \n",
    "For every team, compute a baseline cumulative VORP - this is the sum of all of the players' VORP - let's call this the BCV. For a game, compute the same score but only for the players who are active - let's call this the ACV for active cumulative VORP. The injury quotient would then be the ACV/BCV. The great part about this is that if a team trades for a star player during the trade deadline, that team might have an injury quotient > 1, which makes sense because that team should outperform their past play. \n",
    "\n",
    "The trouble comes with updating the BCV. Let's say a team's starter has a month long injury. That team might start losing at a higher rate, while their injury quotient is low. Eventually, the team's poor play will be reflected in two places - their win% and their injury quotient - which would cause the model to underpredict the team's performance. In reality, the BCV should be updated at some point during the injured player's time out of play, but when should that happen? The same is true when a team trades for a good player. When do you update the BCV so the model doesn't overpredict a team's performance? These difficulties are why this feature should probably be added last. \n"
